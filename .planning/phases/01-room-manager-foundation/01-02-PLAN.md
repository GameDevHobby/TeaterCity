<objective>
Create visual selection highlight and integrate RoomManager with existing systems (room registration on build complete, deselection on tap outside).

Purpose: Complete the selection feature by adding visual feedback and wiring RoomManager into the existing build workflow.

Output: Fully functional room selection with visual highlight, automatic registration, and proper deselection.

  <name>Task 1: Create RoomSelectionHighlight visual component</name>
  <files>scripts/room_building/RoomSelectionHighlight.gd</files>
  <action>
Create `scripts/room_building/RoomSelectionHighlight.gd` as a Control that draws selection highlights:

1. Extend Control (will be wrapped in CanvasLayer by Main.gd for correct screen-space rendering)
2. Use class_name RoomSelectionHighlight

3. Define highlight color constant:
   `const SELECTION_COLOR := Color(1.0, 0.9, 0.2, 0.3)` - semi-transparent yellow

4. In `_ready()`:
   - Connect to `RoomManager.room_selected.connect(_on_room_selected)`
   - Connect to `RoomManager.selection_cleared.connect(_on_selection_cleared)`

5. Signal handlers:
   - `_on_room_selected(_room: RoomInstance) -> void`: call `queue_redraw()`
   - `_on_selection_cleared() -> void`: call `queue_redraw()`

6. Override `_draw() -> void`:
   - Get selected room: `var room = RoomManager.get_selected_room()`
   - If room is null, return early
   - Get room's bounding_box
   - Loop through all tiles in bounding box (x from position.x to position.x + size.x, same for y)
   - For each tile, call `RoomBuildDrawing.draw_tile_highlight(self, Vector2i(x, y), SELECTION_COLOR, get_viewport())`

This follows the exact pattern used in RoomBuildUI._draw_furniture_placement_hints() for drawing tile highlights.

Note: The highlight draws ALL tiles in the room (walls + interior), not just interior. This provides clear visual feedback for the entire room bounds.

**Coordinate space note:** RoomBuildDrawing.draw_tile_highlight() uses IsometricMath.tile_to_screen() which converts world coordinates to screen coordinates via canvas_transform. When this Control is placed inside a CanvasLayer (done by Main.gd in Task 3), the screen coordinates align correctly since CanvasLayer renders in screen space.

  <name>Task 2: Integrate RoomManager with RoomBuildController and Main</name>
  <files>scripts/room_building/RoomBuildController.gd, scripts/Main.gd</files>
  <action>
**Modify scripts/room_building/RoomBuildController.gd:**

In `_on_complete_pressed()`, after `room_completed.emit(current_room)` (around line 162), add:

```gdscript
# Register with RoomManager for selection/editing
RoomManager.register_room(current_room)
```

This ensures every completed room is automatically tracked by RoomManager.

**Modify scripts/Main.gd:**

1. Add to `_ready()` after existing connection:
```gdscript
# Connect to RoomManager selection signals for future menu handling
RoomManager.room_selected.connect(_on_room_selected)
```

2. Add new method to handle selection (placeholder for Phase 2 menu):
```gdscript
func _on_room_selected(room: RoomInstance) -> void:
	# Placeholder for Phase 2 - will show room menu here
	print("Room selected: ", room.id)
```

3. Add to `_unhandled_input()` to handle deselection when tapping outside rooms:
```gdscript
# Deselect room when tapping empty space (touch release not consumed by Area2D)
if event is InputEventScreenTouch and not event.pressed:
	# Small delay to ensure Area2D input_event fires first
	# If we get here, no room area consumed the event
	if RoomManager.get_selected_room():
		RoomManager.clear_selection()
```

Note: The deselection logic works because Area2D.input_event fires BEFORE _unhandled_input. If a room area handles the tap, it marks the event as handled. Only unhandled taps reach _unhandled_input.

Run `grep -n "RoomManager.register_room" scripts/room_building/RoomBuildController.gd` - must exist.
Run `grep -n "RoomManager.clear_selection" scripts/Main.gd` - must exist.
Run `grep -n "room_selected.connect" scripts/Main.gd` - must exist.
Open Godot editor, verify no script errors.

  <done>
RoomBuildController registers rooms on completion. Main.gd handles selection signal and clears selection on tap outside.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add RoomSelectionHighlight with CanvasLayer wrapper to Main</name>
  <files>scripts/Main.gd</files>
  <action>
The RoomSelectionHighlight Control needs to render in screen space. Since Main extends Node2D (not Control), the highlight must be wrapped in a CanvasLayer to ensure correct coordinate alignment.

Add to Main.gd `_ready()` (before or after RoomManager signal connection):

```gdscript
# Create selection highlight overlay in its own CanvasLayer for screen-space rendering
# CanvasLayer ensures the Control draws in screen space (matching tile_to_screen coords)
var selection_layer = CanvasLayer.new()
selection_layer.name = "SelectionHighlightLayer"
selection_layer.layer = 0  # Same layer as game world, but rendered after
add_child(selection_layer)

var selection_highlight = RoomSelectionHighlight.new()
selection_highlight.name = "SelectionHighlight"
selection_highlight.mouse_filter = Control.MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE  # Don't block input
selection_highlight.set_anchors_preset(Control.PRESET_FULL_RECT)  # Cover full screen
selection_layer.add_child(selection_highlight)
```

**Why CanvasLayer is required:**
- Main.tscn root is Node2D, so any Control child would be in world space
- RoomBuildDrawing.draw_tile_highlight() uses IsometricMath.tile_to_screen() which returns screen coordinates
- CanvasLayer renders its children in screen space by default (layer 0 = same as game but in screen coords)
- This matches how RoomBuildUI works - it's inside RoomBuildSystem/UILayer (a CanvasLayer)

**Scene tree order note:** The SelectionHighlightLayer is added as a child of Main after other nodes in _ready(), so it draws after the tilemap layers. The CanvasLayer layer=0 ensures it's in the same visual layer as the game world but the Control draws on top due to scene tree order.

Run the game with `godot --path .`
Build a room (press B, select room type, draw box, place doors, place furniture, complete).
The room should now be registered with RoomManager (check print statement).
Tap the completed room - should see "Room selected: room_1" print.
Tap outside the room - selection should clear.
Visually verify yellow highlight appears on selected room tiles.
  </verify>
  <done>
RoomSelectionHighlight is instantiated inside a CanvasLayer in Main.gd _ready(), draws highlights for selected rooms in correct screen space, and the full selection flow works end-to-end.
  </done>
</task>

## Full Integration Test

1. Start the game: `godot --path .`
2. Build a room:
   - Press B to enter build mode
   - Select a room type
   - Draw a room box
   - Place required doors
   - Place required furniture
   - Click Complete

3. Exit build mode (press B again or it auto-exits)

4. Test selection:
   - Tap inside the completed room -> room should highlight with yellow tint
   - Console should show "Room selected: room_X"

5. Test deselection:
   - Tap outside any room -> highlight should disappear
   - Console should NOT show repeated selection messages

6. Test tap vs drag:
   - Start a tap inside room but drag finger >20px before releasing -> should NOT select
   - Hold tap inside room for >300ms before releasing -> should NOT select (if not already selected, re-selects if quick release)

7. Build a second room, verify both can be selected (only one at a time highlighted)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Completed rooms are automatically registered with RoomManager
2. Tapping a room displays yellow highlight on all tiles
3. Tapping outside any room clears selection
4. Highlight updates correctly when switching between rooms
5. Camera pan (drag) does not trigger selection
6. Selection state accessible via RoomManager.get_selected_room()
7. RoomSelectionHighlight is inside a CanvasLayer for correct screen-space rendering
</success_criteria>
